The P5 compiler/interpreter

Description

This is the 5th version of the Pascal-P compiler from Zurich. This is the
Pascal-P4 compiler modified to be ISO 7185 Pascal compilant, both in the the 
implementation language, and in the language it processes. It is the first 
version of Pascal-P created outside of Zurich.

Pascal-P was an implementation kit, created between 1972 and 1974, for the 
original language Pascal. The source for the original compiler was passed around
and modified quite a bit, but Niklaus Wirth noted that it was very popular, and 
represented a good method to popularize the language. He gathered the source 
into a clean version called Pascal-P2, which was the basis of UCSD Pascal, which
in turn was the base language for Borland Pascal. The Zurich group then created 
an improved version called Pascal-P4.

Pascal-P5 is Pascal-P4 modified to accept all of the ISO 7185 language.
