************************** WHATS NEW IN THIS VERSION ***************************

Welcome to version 1.0

- P5 now passes the BSI compliance test.

- All of the remaining BSI discovered issues were matched with an equivalent
  test in iso7185pat.

- Several bugs, some serious, were solved with the system.

- Reals, which were always passed in string form, now use variable length
  strings to store them. This should result in greatly reduced storage 
  requirements in pcom.

- The script files for Windows compiles were improved considerably. Now they no
  longer just continue after an error.
