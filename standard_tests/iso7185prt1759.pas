PRT test 1759: The execution of any action, operation, or function, defined to
               operate on a variable, is an error if the variable is a 
               program-parameter and, as a result of the binding of the 
               program-parameter, the execution cannot be completed as 
               defined.

               ISO 7185 reference: 6.10

               This is pretty system dependent, and I don't think there is a
               general test that can be defined here.
