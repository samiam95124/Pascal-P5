PRT test 1725: It is an error if a variable created using the second form of 
               new is accessed by the identified variable of the 
               variable-access of a factor, of an assignment-statement, or of 
               an actual-parameter.

               ISO 7185 reference: 6.6.5.3

               I don't know what this means unless they are talking about that
               assigning to a tagfield. Even then it makes no sense, because
               "variable access of a factor" could be just reading the tagfield.

}

program iso7185prt1725;

var a: integer;

begin

end.
